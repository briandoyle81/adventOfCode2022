I've decided to use this one to learn Golang

# 01

The problem so far is trivial, most of my time here is spent learning how to get the data into the program, set up a map of ints to int array/slices, and get the data in that.

For part 2, the natural solution is a heap.  I found a min-heap and couldn't figure out how to modify it, so I just stored the negative of each value.

I also learned that `go run main.go` won't load other files, even if they're in the same package.
